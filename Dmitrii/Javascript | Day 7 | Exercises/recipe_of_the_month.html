    <h3>WHAT IS TABBOULEH SALAD?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Tabbouleh is basically parsley salad. There's technically no lettuce in it. It's a salad made up of parsley,
      tomatoes, bulgur wheat, and green onions – all finely chopped and tossed with olive oil and lemon juice!
      <br>
      Tabbouleh salad (tabouli salad) is probably the most popular Mediterranean salad, and is becoming mainstream in
      American grocery stores all over the country and the world, which is super cool! One thing that I've noticed
      though is that in the states, tabbouleh tends to have more bulgur than the traditional recipe calls for. The way
      we prepare it in Lebanon, the salad should be all about the parsley, with a hint of bulgur thrown in there.

    <h3>WHAT DO YOU NEED TO MAKE A TABBOULEH SALAD</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parsley</strong> – It's a parsley salad, so this is the star of the recipe. Make sure to wash the
        parsley with cold water so it doesn't wilt, and dry it thoroughly with a salad spinner. If you prep the parsley
        a day in advance, it allows the herb to fully dry well for the salad. I prefer to use curly parsley, but
        flat-leaf parsley works well too.</li>
      <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> – Get some fresh and ripe tomatoes, and if they are too juicy, you can remove their
        core before dicing.</li>
      <li><strong>Green</strong> onions – You'll use the entire green onion parts from the white to the green. This will
        give it a subtle taste of onions while blending well with the parsley.</li>
      <li><strong>Bulgur</strong> – Use fine bulgur – the smallest you can find! Bulgur is sold in four numbered grind
        sizes. You want to look for #1, which is the smallest grind. It will resemble couscous, and it's what we use in
        traditional tabbouleh. There is no need to cook this bulgur. It simply needs to be soaked in liquid to become
        tender.</li>
      <li><strong>Lemon</strong> Juice – Freshly squeezed please. :)</li>
      <li><strong>Olive</strong> Oil – Go for high-quality extra virgin olive oil. You'll notice the taste difference!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HOW DO YOU MAKE TABBOULEH</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>I like to start making the tabouleh by mixing the dressing. It's made up of two ingredients: olive oil and
        lemon juice – easy enough! I whisk those together until well blended, and then let the flavor settle while I
        chop the vegetables.</li>
      <li>One important tip I learned though from my mother-in-law is to add the bulgur to the dressing while
        preparing the vegetables. This allows the bulgur to absorb some of the liquid and soften – making it easier to
        chew it in the salad. I used to soak it in water, but I prefer this method because there's no risk of watering
        down the flavor. You'll slowly start to see the bulgur get plump.</li>
      <li>While the bulgur is soaking, prepare yourself for some mad chopping. Tabbouleh requires a lot of chopping –
        it's really a labor of love.</li>
      <li>That includes a bunch (well, technically 2 bunches) of parsley, tomatoes, and green onions. Some people use
        a food processor to chop the parsley. But I find that it can sometimes lead to wilted chopped parsley. So I
        always use a large chef's knife, and it does the trick.</li>
      <li>When you're done chopping, transfer the bulgur and dressing mixture over the chopped vegetables and gently
        mix everything together.</li>
      <li>And that's basically the tabbouleh salad recipe! And it might be the best tabbouleh recipe you'll ever have!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>TIPS TO MAKE THE BEST TABBOULEH SALAD RECIPE</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fine Chopping:</strong> Show off your chopping skills here by finely chopping all the vegetables. It's
        tedious, but the presentation is everything, and you'll get better at it with practice. Avoid using a food
        processor, especially for the parsley, which can wilt the parsley and ruin the texture of the salad.</li>
      <li><strong>Fine Bulgur:</strong> In fact, it should be extra fine bulgur to be precise. The focus of the salad is
        on the parsley, not the bulgur, so you want fine bulgur that incorporates easily into the salad without standing
        out. The bulgur should require no cooking.</li>
      <li><strong>Fine Tomatoes:</strong> You want them to be ripe for flavor's sake, but firm so they don't release too
        much juice. What I like doing is coring the tomatoes to remove the juicy interior and use that for another salad
        recipe. You can also just use a mesh colander to drain the liquids from chopped tomatoes.</li>
    </ul>
