      <h3>WHAT IS TABBOULEH SALAD?</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Tabbouleh is basically parsley salad. There's technically no lettuce in
        it. It's a salad made up of parsley, tomatoes, bulgur wheat, and green
        onions – all finely chopped and tossed with olive oil and lemon juice!
        <br />
        Tabbouleh salad (tabouli salad) is probably the most popular
        Mediterranean salad, and is becoming mainstream in American grocery
        stores all over the country and the world, which is super cool! One
        thing that I've noticed though is that in the states, tabbouleh tends to
        have more bulgur than the traditional recipe calls for. The way we
        prepare it in Lebanon, the salad should be all about the parsley, with a
        hint of bulgur thrown in there.

      <h3>WHAT DO YOU NEED TO MAKE A TABBOULEH SALAD</h3>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Parsley</strong> – It's a parsley salad, so this is the star
          of the recipe. Make sure to wash the parsley with cold water so it
          doesn't wilt, and dry it thoroughly with a salad spinner. If you prep
          the parsley a day in advance, it allows the herb to fully dry well for
          the salad. I prefer to use curly parsley, but flat-leaf parsley works
          well too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tomatoes</strong> – Get some fresh and ripe tomatoes, and if
          they are too juicy, you can remove their core before dicing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Green</strong> onions – You'll use the entire green onion
          parts from the white to the green. This will give it a subtle taste of
          onions while blending well with the parsley.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bulgur</strong> – Use fine bulgur – the smallest you can find!
          Bulgur is sold in four numbered grind sizes. You want to look for #1,
          which is the smallest grind. It will resemble couscous, and it's what
          we use in traditional tabbouleh. There is no need to cook this bulgur.
          It simply needs to be soaked in liquid to become tender.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lemon</strong> Juice – Freshly squeezed please. :)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Olive</strong> Oil – Go for high-quality extra virgin olive
          oil. You'll notice the taste difference!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>HOW DO YOU MAKE TABBOULEH</h3>
      <hr />
      <ol>
        <li>
          I like to start making the tabouleh by mixing the dressing. It's made
          up of two ingredients: olive oil and lemon juice – easy enough! I
          whisk those together until well blended, and then let the flavor
          settle while I chop the vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          One important tip I learned though from my mother-in-law is to add the
          bulgur to the dressing while preparing the vegetables. This allows the
          bulgur to absorb some of the liquid and soften – making it easier to
          chew it in the salad. I used to soak it in water, but I prefer this
          method because there's no risk of watering down the flavor. You'll
          slowly start to see the bulgur get plump.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the bulgur is soaking, prepare yourself for some mad chopping.
          Tabbouleh requires a lot of chopping – it's really a labor of love.
        </li>
        <li>
          That includes a bunch (well, technically 2 bunches) of parsley,
          tomatoes, and green onions. Some people use a food processor to chop
          the parsley. But I find that it can sometimes lead to wilted chopped
          parsley. So I always use a large chef's knife, and it does the trick.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you're done chopping, transfer the bulgur and dressing mixture
          over the chopped vegetables and gently mix everything together.
        </li>
        <li>
          And that's basically the tabbouleh salad recipe! And it might be the
          best tabbouleh recipe you'll ever have!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>TIPS TO MAKE THE BEST TABBOULEH SALAD RECIPE</h3>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine Chopping:</strong> Show off your chopping skills here by
          finely chopping all the vegetables. It's tedious, but the presentation
          is everything, and you'll get better at it with practice. Avoid using
          a food processor, especially for the parsley, which can wilt the
          parsley and ruin the texture of the salad.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine Bulgur:</strong> In fact, it should be extra fine bulgur
          to be precise. The focus of the salad is on the parsley, not the
          bulgur, so you want fine bulgur that incorporates easily into the
          salad without standing out. The bulgur should require no cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine Tomatoes:</strong> You want them to be ripe for flavor's
          sake, but firm so they don't release too much juice. What I like doing
          is coring the tomatoes to remove the juicy interior and use that for
          another salad recipe. You can also just use a mesh colander to drain
          the liquids from chopped tomatoes.
        </li>
      </ul>
